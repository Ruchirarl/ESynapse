"""
This script generates a continuous, realistic stream of e-commerce events and
publishes them to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

Key features of the simulation include:
- Stateful user sessions with complex journeys (view, add to cart, purchase, return).
- Simulation of repeat users who purchase items from previous sessions.
- Realistic seasonality patterns, including daily peaks and off-peak hours.
- Handles out-of-stock scenarios from the product catalog.
